# android-playground
Exploration of the latest Android technologies, patterns and libraries.

**Note** - Very much in early experimental stages.

This project is my personal playground for trying out new Android concepts and technologies.

The current code is primarily a basic illustration of a MVVM architecture with Kotlin, coroutines, LiveData and Retrofit coroutine integration to fetch JSON data from a remote server.
