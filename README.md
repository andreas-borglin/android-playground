# android-playground
Exploration of the latest Android technologies, patterns and libraries.

**Note** - Purely early experimental stages

This project is my personal playground for trying out Android concepts and technologies.

I'm used to working with RxJava and Dagger, and wanted to see what a MVVM based
architecture would look like using coroutines and Koin instead and how it affects testability.

The current code is a basic experiment with
- Kotlin + coroutines
- MVVM architecture
- DI with Koin
- Jetpack navigation
- LiveData 
- Retrofit coroutine integration to fetch JSON data from a remote server.
